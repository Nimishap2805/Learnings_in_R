## ðŸ“Œ What I've Learned So Far  

âœ… **Data Selection** â€“ Filtering, subsetting, and handling missing values.  
âœ… **Data Manipulation** â€“ Using `dplyr` for transforming and structuring datasets.  
âœ… **Data Visualization** â€“ Creating plots with `ggplot2` and base R.  
âœ… **Data Analysis** â€“ Performing statistical tests and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

I keep updating this folder as I **learn new R concepts and apply them** to different datasets! ðŸš€
